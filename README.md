## Issues

- Fix: turning a normal expense into recurrent produces two records
- Fix: The "Spending" tab does not show categories that don't have expenses in the selected month
- The buttons that make API calls are missing:
    - loading indicators
    - error handling
- TBD: should we delete the idb database on logout?
- Syncing data during startup should display a loading indicator (if it takes longer than 100ms in which case it should be visible for at least 300ms)
- TDB: should we validate all the data types (transactions, accounts, etc)?
- TDB: should we only accept alpha chars for IDs?
