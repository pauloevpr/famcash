# TODO

## Now
 
- force income to have a name
- make expense to have an optional name; move the field down and call it notes  
- summary calculation for current and future months: some up the planned spending from the categories; use it as total spending if it is larger than actual spending
- display "Planned" indicator in the summary for the current and future months 
- display planned amount in the category list
- display plan editing in the category editing form
- on desktop, improve the nav bar so it links to the main pages (home, categories, accounts); keep the plus and menu button still
- add support for transfering
- introduce carryover review - display indicators to get people to confirm the actual carryover amount; display a check on confirmed carryovers?
- auth: session expiration should auto extend as requests come in

## Issues

- Fix: many <input> have min instead of minlenght for text validation
- Fix: turning a normal expense into recurrent produces two records
- Fix: The "Spending" tab does not show categories that don't have expenses in the selected month
- The buttons that make API calls are missing:
    - loading indicators
        - only displays if it takes longer than 100ms, then shows for at least 300ms
    - error handling
- all pages dont handle empty state 
- all forms dont use useSubmission for error handling, loading indicator, prevent concurrency
- TBD: should we delete the idb database on logout?
- Syncing data during startup should display a loading indicator (if it takes longer than 100ms in which case it should be visible for at least 300ms)
- TDB: should we validate all the data types (transactions, accounts, etc)?
- TDB: should we only accept alpha chars for IDs?
